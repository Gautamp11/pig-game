  1. Player 1 initiates the game.
  2. Each player takes turns rolling a dice, with the result being added to their current score.
  3. A player can continue accumulating their current score until they roll a 1, which results in losing their entire current score.
  4. Players have the option to 'hold' their current score, adding it to their total score.
  5. Once a player holds or loses their current score, it becomes the next player's turn.
  6. The game continues until one player reaches a total score of 100, at which point they are declared the winner.</pre
